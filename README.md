- Movie Management System Task

--- Requirements to run
1- Create .env file using the variables on '.env.example' file.
2- Do 'npm install'.
3- Run the command 'npm run db:push' to do the initial migration.
4- Run the command 'npm run start:dev'

Now, you can navigate to localhost:3000 to get your first response from API. You can also go to localhost:3000/swagger to see the API documentation.

--- How to test
After doing first three requirements, call the command 'npm run test' or 'npm run test:e2e'

Since Swagger API is well documented, everything is typed, I am not adding any else document here.
